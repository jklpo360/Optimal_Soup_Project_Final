# 8 days

8 days to make this 100% material. It may not be enough to get me to a C(please inform me if I can actually get a C with 100% because that will motivate me a lot), but I'll give it a shot.

My goal is to get the basic stuff down and then migrate it to HTML and attempt to get it to the quality threshhold that the food blogs I source from have.

(not working, just email me)
