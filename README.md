# 8 days

8 days to make this 100% material. It may not be enough to get me to a C, but I'll give it a shot.

My goal is to get the basic stuff down and then migrate it to HTML and attempt to get it to the quality threshhold that the food blogs I source from have.

<div id="feedback-main">
  <div id="feedback-div">
    <form action="contact.php" method="post" class="form" id="feedback-form1" name="form1" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div class="feedback-submit">
        <input type="submit" value="SEND" id="feedback-button-blue" />
        <div class="feedback-ease"></div>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>

<button id="popup" class="feedback-button" onclick="toggle_visibility()">Feedback</button>
<script src="_include/js/feedback.js"></script>
